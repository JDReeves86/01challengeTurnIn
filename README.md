### About ###
1. Ensure HTML uses semantic elements.
  > When initially received, HTML code used primarily <div> elements to break up sections. While allowing for a clean looking structure, it fails to meet semantic HTML criteria. <div> elements changed out for semantic elements that better allow for clearer flow of content. E.g <section> & <aside> elements.

2. Maintain orderly and logical flow of HTML/CSS.
  > HTML flows top to bottom, ensuring elements for the top of the page such as headers remain at the top and elements for the bottom such as footer remain at the bottom. CSS was refactored to flow from one section to the next, ensuring each element was styled before moving to the next element in sequence. Initial code while providing for polished finished product, was all over the place with regards to the sequencing of how elements were styled.

3. Ensure HTML meets accesibility standards with alt attributes for images & icons.
  > Images initially had no description in the form of an alt tag. Alt tags provided for each image and icon to ensure descriptions were present for any images to be viewed by a screen reader for the vision impaired user.

4. Ensure clear/concise title for page.
  >Page initially had vague placeholder title. While no specific direction was given from source code for taglines or slogans. I took the liberty to create a simple slogan "Enhance your digital presence" based on the apparent function of the company.
